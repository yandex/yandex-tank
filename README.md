# Yandex Tank
## Description
Yandex.Tank is a console HTTP load testing instrument.

### Installation and Configuration

You should add proper repositories on Debian-based environment. 

For instance, add following repos to ```sources.list``` :

```
# Ubuntu Lucid/Precise
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/yandex-load/main/ubuntu precise main 
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/yandex-load/main/ubuntu precise main
```
or this way
```sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yandex-load/main```

Then update package list and install ```yandex-load-tank-base``` package:
```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yandex-load-tank-base```

For mild load tests (less then 1000rps) an average laptop with 32/64bit Ubuntu (Lucid/Precise) would be sufficient. The tank could be easily used in virtual machine if queries aren't too heavy and load isn't too big.
Otherwise it is recommended to request a physical server or a more capable virtual machine from your admin.

### Firewall

Before test execution, please, check service availability. If service is running on server with IP x.x.x.x and listening for TCP port zz, try to connect to it with ```telnet``` like this:
```telnet x.x.x.x zz```
If everything OK, you'll see:
```
$ telnet 23.23.23.23 80
Trying 23.23.23.23...
Connected to 23.23.23.23.
Escape character is '^]'.
```
Otherwise if port is unreacheable:
```
$ telnet 8.8.8.8 80
Trying 8.8.8.8...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out
```
(it's just an example, programs like ```nc/nmap/wget/curl``` could be used as well, but not ping!)
### Routing
OK, service is reachable, next thing you should know is how far Yandex.Tank is located from the service you'd like to test. Heavy load can make switch to be unresponsible or to reboot, or at least it may lead to network losses, so the test results would be distorted. Be careful. Path estimation could be done by execution of ```tracepath``` command or it analogs (```tracert/traceroute```) on Yandex.Tank machine:

```
$ tracepath 23.23.23.24
 1:  tank.example.com (23.23.23.23)            0.084ms pmtu 1450
 1:  target.load.example.com (23.23.23.24)           20.919ms reached
 1:  target.example.com (23.23.23.24)            0.128ms reached
     Resume: pmtu 1450 hops 1 back 64
```
Hops count = 1 means that tank and target are in closest location.

```
$ tracepath 24.24.24.24
 1:  1.example.com (124.24.24.24)                 0.084ms pmtu 1450
 1:  2.example.com (24.124.24.24)          0.276ms 
 1:  3.example.com (24.24.124.24)          0.411ms 
 2:  4.example.com (24.24.24.124)                0.514ms 
 3:  5.example.com (241.24.24.24)              10.690ms 
 4:  6.example.com (24.241.24.24)                  0.831ms asymm  3 
 5:  7.example.com (24.24.241.24)                 0.512ms 
 6:  8.example.com (24.24.24.241)                 0.525ms asymm  5 
 7:  no reply
```
In this example you'd better find another closer located tank.

### Tuning
To achieve the top most performance you should tune the source server system limits:
```
ulimit -n 30000

net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 65536
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 0
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 131072
net.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 3
net.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 3
net.ipv4.tcp_retries1 = 3
net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 = 8
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 16384 174760 349520
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 16384 131072 262144
net.ipv4.tcp_mem = 262144 524288 1048576
net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 65536
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 0
```

## Usage
So, you've installed Yandex.Tank to a proper server, close to target, access is permitted and server is tuned.
How to make a test?

### First Step
Create a file on a server with Yandex.Tank:

**load.conf**
```
address=23.23.23.23:80 #Target's address and port .
load =  line(1, 100, 10m) #load scheme 
```
!!Attention: IP address allowed only, not FQDN!!
Yandex.Tank have 3 primitives for describing load scheme:
   1. ```step (a,b,step,dur)``` makes stepped load, where a,b are start/end load values, step - increment value, dur - step duration.
   2. ```line (a,b,dur)``` makes linear load, where a,b are start/end load, dur - the time for linear load increase from a to b.
   3. ```const (load,dur)``` makes constant load. load - rps amount, dur - load duration.
You can set fractional load like this: ```const (a/b,dur)``` -- a/b rps, where a >= 0, b > 0.
Note: ```const(0, 10)``` - 0 rps for 10 seconds, in fact 10s pause in a test.

```step``` and ```line``` could be used with increasing and decreasing intensity:
```step(25, 5, 5, 60)``` - stepped load from 25 to 5 rps, with 5 rps steps, step duration 60s.
```step(5, 25, 5, 60)``` - stepped load from 5 to 25 rps, with 5 rps steps, step duration 60s
```line(100, 1, 10m)``` - linear load from 100 to 1 rps, duration - 10 minutes
```line(1, 100, 10m)``` - linear load from 1 to 100 rps, duration - 10 minutes

Time duration could be defined in second (without dimension), minutes (m) and hours (h). For example: ```27h103m645```

For a test with constant load at 10rps for 10 minutes, load.conf should have next lines:
```
address=23.23.23.23:80 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
```
Voilà, Yandex.Tank setup is done.

### Preparing requests
There are two ways to set up requests.
#### URI-style
URIs listed in load.conf or in a separate file.

##### URIs in load.conf
Update configuration file with HTTP headers and URIs:
```
address=23.23.23.23:80 # Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) # Load scheme
# Headers and URIs for GET requests
header_http = 1.1
header = [Host: www.target.example.com]
header = [Connection: close]
uri = /
uri = /buy
uri = /sdfg?sdf=rwerf
uri = /sdfbv/swdfvs/ssfsf
```
Parameters ```header``` define headers values.
```uri``` contains uri, which should be used for requests generation.

##### URIs in file
Create a file with declared requests:
**ammo.txt**
```
[Connection: close]
[Host: target.example.com]
[Cookies: None]
/?drg
/
/buy
/buy/?rt=0&station_to=7&station_from=9
```

File begins with optional lines [...], that contain headers which will be added to every request. After that section there is a list of URIs. Every URI must begin from a new line, with leading '/'.
#### Request-style
Full requests listed in a separate file.
For more complex requests, like POST, you'll have to create a special file. 
File format is:
```
[size_of_request] [tag]\n
[body_request]
\r\n
[size_of_request2] [tag]\n
[body_request2]
\r\n
```
where size_of_request – request size in bytes. 
'\r\n' symbols after body_requests are ignored and not sent anywhere, but it is required to include it in a file after each request. '\r' is also required.

**sample GET requests**
```

```

### Run Test!

1. Request specs in load.conf
```
lunapark
```

2. Request specs in ammo.txt
```
lunapark ammo.txt
```

Yandex.Tank detects requests format and generates ultimate requests versions.

```lunapark``` here is an executable file name of Yandex.Tank.

If Yandex.Tank has been installed properly and configuration file is correct, the load will be given in next few seconds.

### Results
During test execution you'll see HTTP and net errors, answer times distribution, progressbar and other interesting data.
At the same time file ```phout.txt``` is being written, which could be analyzed later.

### Tags
Requests could be grouped and marked by some tag. Example of file with requests and tags:
```
73 good
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: xxx.tanks.example.com
User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)

77 bad
GET /abra HTTP/1.0
Host: xxx.tanks.example.com
User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)

78 unknown
GET /ab ra HTTP/1.0
Host: xxx.tanks.example.com
User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)
```
'good', 'bad' and 'unknown' here are the tags.
**RESTRICTION: latin letters allowed only.**

### SSL
To activate SSL add 'ssl = 1' to load.conf. Don't forget to change port number to appropriate value.
Now, our basic config looks like that: 
```
address=23.23.23.23:443 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
ssl=1
```
### Autostop
Autostop is an ability to automatically halt test execution if some conditions are reached.
#### HTTP and Net codes conditions
There is an option to define specific codes (404,503,100) as well as code groups (3xx, 5xx, xx). Also you can define relative threshold (percent from the whole amount of answer per second) or absolute (amount of answers with specified code per second). 
Examples:
```autostop = http(4xx,25%,10)``` – stop test, if amount of 4xx http codes in every second of last 10s period exceeds 25% of answers (relative threshold)
```autostop = net(101,25,10)``` – stop test, if amount of 101 net-codes in every second of last 10s period is more than 25 (absolute threshold)
```autostop = net(xx,25,10)``` – stop test, if amount of non-zero net-codes in every second of last 10s period is more than 25 (absolute threshold)

#### Average time conditions
Example:
```autostop = time(1500,15)``` – stop test, if average answer time exceeds 1500ms

So, if we want to stop test when all answers in 1 second period are 5xx, add autostop line to load.conf:
```
address=23.23.23.23:443 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load schemessl=1
autostop = http(5xx,100%,1)
```

### Logging
Looking into target's answers is quite useful in debugging. For doing that add 'writelog = 1' to load.conf.
**ATTENTION: Writing answers on high load leads to intensive disk i/o usage and can affect test accuracy.**
Log format:
```
<metrics>
<body_request>
<body_answer>
```

Where metrics are:
```size_in size_out response_time(interval_real) interval_event net_code``` (request size, answer size, response time, time to wait for response from the server, answer network code)
Example:
```
user@tank:~$ head answ_*.txt 
553 572 8056 8043 0
GET /create-issue HTTP/1.1
Host: target.yandex.net
User-Agent: tank
Accept: */*
Connection: close


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/javascript;charset=UTF-8
```

For ```load.conf``` like this:
```
instances=10
address=23.23.23.23:443 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
ssl=1
autostop = http(5xx,100%,1)
writelog=1
```

### Results in phout
phout.txt - is a per-request log. It could be used for service behaviour analysis (Excel/gnuplot/etc)
It has following fields: ```time, tag, interval_real, connect_time, send_time, latency, receive_time, interval_event, size_out, size_in, net_code proto_code```

Phout example:

```
**NOTE:** as Yandex.Tank uses phantom as an http load engine and this file is written by phantom, it contents depends on phantom version installed on your Yandex.Tank system.

### Graph and statistics
Use your favorite stats packet, R, for example. Internal stat and graphing tool is under construction.

### Custom timings
You can set custom timings in ```load.conf``` with ```time_periods``` parameter like this:
```
instances=10
address=23.23.23.23:443 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
time_periods = 10 45 50 100 150 300 500 1s 1500 2s 3s 10s # the last value - 10s is considered as connect timeout.
```

### Thread limit
```instances=N``` in ```load.conf``` limits number of simultanious connections (threads).
Test with 10 threads:
```
instances=10
address=23.23.23.23:443 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
```

### Dynamic thread limit
```instances_schedule = <instances increasing scheme>``` -- test with active instances schedule will be performed if load scheme is not defined. Bear in mind that active instances number cannot be decreased and final number of them must be equal to ```instances``` parameter value.
load.conf example:
```
instances=10
instances_schedule = line(1,10,10m)
address=23.23.23.23:443 #Target's address and port
#load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme is excluded from this load.conf as we used instances_schedule parameter
```

### Custom stateless protocol
In necessity of testing stateless HTTP-like protocol, Yandex.Tank's HTTP parser could be switched off, providing ability to generate load with any data, receiving any answer in return.
To do that add ```tank_type = 2``` to ```load.conf```. 
**Indispensable condition: Connection close must be initiated by remote side**
load.conf example:
```
instances=10
address=23.23.23.23:80 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
tank_type=2
```
### Gatling
If server with Yandex.Tank have several IPs, they may be used to avoid outcome port shortage. Use ```gatling_ip``` parameter for that.
Load.conf:
```
instances=10
address=23.23.23.23:80 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
gatling_ip = 23.23.23.24 23.23.23.26
```
**run lunapark with -g key**

### Sources
Yandex.Tank sources ((https://github.com/yandex-load/yandex-tank here)).
### load.conf.example
```
# Lunapark config file
address=23.23.23.23:443 #Target's address and port
load = const (10,10m) #Load scheme
#  Headers and URIs for GET requests
header_http = 1.1
header = [Host: www.target.example.com]
header = [Connection: close]
uri = /
#ssl=1
#autostop = http(5xx,100%,1)
#instances=10
#writelog=1
#time_periods = 10 45 50 100 150 300 500 1s 1500 2s 3s 10s # the last value - 10s is considered as connect timeout.
#instances_schedule = line (1,1000,10m)
#tank_type=2
#gatling_ip = 141.8.153.82 141.8.153.81

```
