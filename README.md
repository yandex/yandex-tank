  * [JMeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/) is an extendable and widely known one
  * BFG is an experimental Python-based generator that allows you to write your own shooter function (included)
* customizable reports in .html with pretty interactive charts based on [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) library
* [graphite](https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html) support
* several ammo formats supported like plain url list or access.log
* test autostop plugin
* customizable and extendable monitoring that works over SSH

## Install from PyPI
You will need some packages that are required for building different python libraries:
```
libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev zlib1g-dev
```
You will also need a GNU make for building them. In Ubuntu you can install a ```build-essential``` package. You should also install pip if you don't have it.
Full command for Ubuntu looks like this:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev zlib1g-dev
```
You can do similar thing for your distribution. After you've installed all the packages, it is easy to install the Tank itself:
```
sudo pip install yandextank
```
Remember that if you want to use ```phantom``` as a load generator you should install it separately. On Ubuntu you can do that by adding our PPA and installing ```phantom``` and ```phantom-ssl``` packages. On other distros you will maybe need to build it from sources.
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yandex-load/main && sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install phantom phantom-ssl
```

**Report plugin** is a distinct project. You can found it [here](https://github.com/yandex-load/yatank-online).
