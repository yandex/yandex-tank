So, you've installed Yandex.Tank to a proper machine, it is close to target,
access is permitted and server is tuned. How to make a test?

.. note::

  This guide is for ``phantom`` load generator.

Create a file on a server with Yandex.Tank: **load.yaml**

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80 # [Target's address]:[target's port]
    uris:
      - /
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps # schedule load by defining requests per second
      schedule: line(1, 10, 10m) # starting from 1rps growing linearly to 10rps during 10 minutes
  console:
    enabled: true # enable console output
  telegraf:
    enabled: false # let's disable telegraf monitoring for the first time

And run:
``$ yandex-tank -c load.yaml``

------------

``phantom`` have 3 primitives for describing load scheme:

 1. ``step (a,b,step,dur)`` makes stepped load, where a,b are start/end load values, step - increment value, dur - step duration.

  Examples:
   * ``step(25, 5, 5, 60)`` - stepped load from 25 to 5 rps, with 5 rps steps, step duration 60s.
   * ``step(5, 25, 5, 60)`` - stepped load from 5 to 25 rps, with 5 rps steps, step duration 60s

 2. ``line (a,b,dur)`` makes linear load, where ``a,b`` are start/end load, ``dur`` - the time for linear load increase from a to b.

  Examples:
   * ``line(10, 1, 10m)`` - linear load from 10 to 1 rps, duration - 10 minutes
   * ``line(1, 10, 10m)`` - linear load from 1 to 10 rps, duration - 10 minutes

 3. ``const (load,dur)`` makes constant load. ``load`` - rps amount, ``dur`` - load duration.

  Examples:
   * ``const(10,10m)`` - constant load for 10 rps for 10 minutes.
   * ``const(0, 10)`` - 0 rps for 10 seconds, in fact 10s pause in a test.

.. note::
 You can set fractional load like this:
  ``line(1.1, 2.5, 10)`` - from 1.1rps to 2.5 for 10 seconds.

.. note::
 ``step`` and ``line`` could be used with increasing and decreasing intensity:


You can specify complex load schemes using those primitives.

Example:
  ``schedule: line(1, 10, 10m) const(10,10m)``
  
  linear load from 1 to 10rps during 10 minutes, then 10 minutes of 10rps constant load.

Time duration could be defined in seconds, minutes (m) and hours (h).
For example: ``27h103m645``

For a test with constant load at 10rps for 10 minutes, ``load.yaml`` should
have following lines:

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80 # [Target's address]:[target's port]
    uris:
      - /uri1
      - /uri2
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps # schedule load by defining requests per second
      schedule: const(10, 10m) # starting from 1rps growing linearly to 10rps during 10 minutes
  console:
    enabled: true # enable console output
  telegraf:
    enabled: false # let's disable telegraf monitoring for the first time


Preparing requests
==================

There are several ways to set up requests: 
 * Access mode 
 * URI-style
 * URI+POST
 * request-style. 

.. note:: 
  Request-style is default ammo type.

.. note::
  Regardless of the chosen format, resulted file with requests could be gzipped - tank supports archived ammo files.

To specify external ammo file use ``ammofile`` option. 

.. note::
  You can specify URL of the ammofile, http(s). Small ammofiles (~<100MB) will be downloaded as is,
  to directory ``/tmp/<hash>``, large files will be read from stream.

.. note::

  If ammo type is uri-style or request-style, tank will try to guess it.
  Use ``ammo_type`` option to explicitly specify ammo format. Don't forget to change ``ammo_type`` option
  if you switch format of your ammo, otherwise you might get errors.

  Example:
  ::
      
    phantom:
      address: 203.0.113.1:80
      ammofile: https://yourhost.tld/path/to/ammofile.txt


URI-style, URIs in load.yaml
----------------------------

YAML-file configuration: Don't specify ``ammo_type`` explicitly for this type of ammo.

Update configuration file with HTTP headers and URIs:

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps
      schedule: line(1, 10, 10m)
    header_http: "1.1"
    headers:
      - "[Host: www.target.example.com]"
      - "[Connection: close]"
    uris:
      - "/uri1"
      - "/buy"
      - "/sdfg?sdf=rwerf"
      - "/sdfbv/swdfvs/ssfsf"
  console:
    enabled: true
  telegraf:
    enabled: false

Parameter ``uris`` contains uri, which should be used for requests generation.

.. note::

  Pay attention to the sample above, because whitespaces in multiline ``uris`` and ``headers`` options are important.

URI-style, URIs in file
-----------------------

YAML-file configuration: ``ammo_type: uri``

Create a file with declared requests: ``ammo.txt``

::

  [Connection: close] 
  [Host: target.example.com] 
  [Cookie: None] 
  /?drg tag1
  / 
  /buy tag2 
  [Cookie: test]
  /buy/?rt=0&station_to=7&station_from=9

File consists of list of URIs and headers to be added to every request defined below.
Every URI must begin from a new line, with leading ``/``.
Each line that begins from ``[`` is considered as a header.
Headers could be (re)defined in the middle of URIs, as in sample above. 

Example:
  Request ``/buy/?rt=0&station_to=7&station_from=9`` will be sent with ``Cookie: test``, not ``Cookie: None``. 

Request may be marked by tag, you can specify it with whitespace following URI.

URI+POST-style
--------------

YAML-file configuration: ``ammo_type: uripost``

Create a file with declared requests: ``ammo.txt``

::

  [Host: example.org]
  [Connection: close] 
  [User-Agent: Tank]  
  5 /route/?rll=50.262025%2C53.276083~50.056015%2C53.495561&origin=1&simplify=1
  class
  10 /route/?rll=50.262025%2C53.276083~50.056015%2C53.495561&origin=1&simplify=1
  hello!clas
  7 /route/?rll=37.565147%2C55.695758~37.412796%2C55.691454&origin=1&simplify=1
  uripost

File begins with optional lines [...], that contain headers which will
be added to every request. After that section there is a list of URIs and POST bodies.
Each URI line begins with a number which is the size of the following POST body.


Request-style
-------------

YAML-file configuration: ``ammo_type: phantom``

Full requests listed in a separate file. For more complex
requests, like POST, you'll have to create a special file. File format
is:

::

  [size_of_request] [tag]\n
  [request_headers]
  [body_of_request]\r\n
  [size_of_request2] [tag2]\n
  [request2_headers]
  [body_of_request2]\r\n


where ``size_of_request`` – request size in bytes. '\r\n' symbols after
``body`` are ignored and not sent anywhere, but it is required to
include them in a file after each request. Pay attention to the sample above
because '\r' symbols are strictly required. 

.. note:: 

  Parameter ``ammo_type`` is unnecessary, request-style is default ammo type.

sample ammo generators you may find on the :doc:`ammo_generators` page.
  


Run Test!
=========

1. Request specs in load.yaml -- run as ``yandex-tank -c load.yaml``
2. Request specs in ammo.txt -- run as ``yandex-tank -c load.yaml ammo.txt``

Yandex.Tank detects requests format and generates ultimate requests
versions.

``yandex-tank`` here is an executable file name of Yandex.Tank.

If Yandex.Tank has been installed properly and configuration file is
correct, the load will be given in next few seconds.

Results
=======

During test execution you'll see HTTP and net errors, answer times
distribution, progressbar and other interesting data. At the same time
file ``phout.txt`` is being written, which could be analyzed later.

If you need more human-readable report, you can try Report plugin,
You can find it `here <https://github.com/yandex-load/yatank-online>`_

If you need to upload results to an external storage, such as Graphite or InfluxDB, you can use one of existing artifacts uploading modules :doc:`core_and_modules`

Tags
====

Requests could be grouped and marked by some tag. 

Example:
::

  73 good 
  GET / HTTP/1.0 
  Host: xxx.tanks.example.com 
  User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)
  
  77 bad 
  GET /abra HTTP/1.0 
  Host: xxx.tanks.example.com 
  User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)
  
  75 unknown 
  GET /ab HTTP/1.0 
  Host: xxx.tanks.example.com 
  User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)

``good``, ``bad`` and ``unknown`` here are the tags.

.. note::

  **RESTRICTION: utf-8 symbols only**

SSL
===

To activate SSL add ``phantom: {ssl: true}`` to ``load.yaml``. 
Now, our basic config looks like that:

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:443
      load_profile:
        load_type: rps
        schedule: line(1, 10, 10m)
    ssl: true

.. note::

  Do not forget to specify ssl port to `address`. Otherwise, you might get 'protocol errors'.

Autostop 
========

Autostop is an ability to automatically halt test execution
if some conditions are reached. 

HTTP and Net codes conditions 
-----------------------------

There is an option to define specific codes (404,503,100) as well as code
groups (3xx, 5xx, xx). Also you can define relative threshold (percent
from the whole amount of answer per second) or absolute (amount of
answers with specified code per second). 

Examples:

  ``autostop: http(4xx,25%,10)`` – stop test, if amount of 4xx http codes in every second of last 10s period exceeds 25% of answers (relative threshold).

  ``autostop: net(101,25,10)`` – stop test, if amount of 101 net-codes in every second of last 10s period is more than 25 (absolute threshold).

  ``autostop: net(xx,25,10)`` – stop test, if amount of non-zero net-codes in every second of last 10s period is more than 25 (absolute threshold).

Average time conditions
-----------------------

Example: 
  ``autostop: time(1500,15)`` – stops test, if average answer time exceeds 1500ms.

So, if we want to stop test when all answers in 1 second period are 5xx plus some network and timing factors - add autostop line to load.yaml:

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps
      schedule: line(1, 10, 10m)
  autostop:
    autostop:
      - time(1s,10s)
      - http(5xx,100%,1s)
      - net(xx,1,30)

Logging
=======

Looking into target's answers is quite useful in debugging. For doing
that use parameter `writelog <http://yandextank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_reference.html#writelog-string>`_, e.g. add ``phantom: {writelog: all}`` to ``load.yaml`` to log all messages.

.. note::
  Writing answers on high load leads to intensive disk i/o 
  usage and can affect test accuracy.** 

Log format: 

::

  <metrics> 
  <body_request>
  <body_answer>

Where metrics are:

``size_in size_out response_time(interval_real) interval_event net_code``
(request size, answer size, response time, time to wait for response
from the server, answer network code) 

Example: 

::

  user@tank:~$ head answ_*.txt 
  553 572 8056 8043 0
  GET /create-issue HTTP/1.1
  Host: target.yandex.net
  User-Agent: tank
  Accept: */*
  Connection: close
  
  
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/javascript;charset=UTF-8

For ``load.yaml`` like this:
  
.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps
      schedule: line(1, 10, 10m)
    writelog: all
  autostop:
    autostop:
      - time(1,10)
      - http(5xx,100%,1s)
      - net(xx,1,30)

Results in phout
================

phout.txt - is a per-request log. It could be used for service behaviour
analysis (Excel/gnuplot/etc) It has following fields:
``time, tag, interval_real, connect_time, send_time, latency, receive_time, interval_event, size_out, size_in, net_code proto_code``

Graph and statistics
====================

Use `Report plugin <https://github.com/yandex-load/yatank-online>`_ 
OR
use your favorite stats packet, R, for example.


Thread limit
============

``instances: N`` in ``load.yaml`` limits number of simultanious
connections (threads). 

Example with 10 threads limit:

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps
      schedule: line(1, 10, 10m)
    instances: 10

Dynamic thread limit
====================

You can specify ``load_type: instances`` instead of 'rps' to schedule a number of active instances
which generate as much rps as they manage to.
Bear in mind that active instances number cannot be decreased
and final number of them must be equal to ``instances`` parameter value.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80
    load_profile:
      load_type: instances
      schedule: line(1,10,10m)
    instances: 10
    loop: 10000 # don't stop when the end of ammo is reached but loop it 10000 times

.. note::
  When using ``load_type: instances`` you should specify how many loops of
  ammo you want to generate because tank can't find out from the schedule
  how many ammo do you need

Custom stateless protocol
=========================

In necessity of testing stateless HTTP-like protocol, Yandex.Tank's HTTP
parser could be switched off, providing ability to generate load with
any data, receiving any answer in return. To do that use
`tank_type <http://yandextank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_reference.html#tank-type-string>`_ parameter:

.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps
      schedule: line(1, 10, 10m)
    instances: 10
    tank_type: none

.. note::

  **Indispensable condition: Connection close must be initiated by remote side**

Gatling 
=======

If server with Yandex.Tank have several IPs, they may be
used to avoid outcome port shortage. Use ``gatling_ip`` parameter for
that. load.yaml:


.. code-block:: yaml

  phantom:
    address: 203.0.113.1:80
    load_profile:
      load_type: rps
      schedule: line(1, 10, 10m)
    instances: 10
    gatling_ip: IP1 IP2
