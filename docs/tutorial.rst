Usage
-----

So, you've installed Yandex.Tank to a proper machine, it is close to target,
access is permitted and server is tuned. How to make a test?

First Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a file on a server with Yandex.Tank: **load.ini**

::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  rps_schedule=line(1, 100, 10m) ;load scheme

Yandex.Tank have 3 primitives for describing load scheme: 

1. ``step (a,b,step,dur)`` makes stepped load, where a,b are start/end load
values, step - increment value, dur - step duration. 

2. ``line (a,b,dur)`` makes linear load, where ``a,b`` are start/end load, ``dur``
- the time for linear load increase from a to b. 

3. ``const (load,dur)`` makes constant load. ``load`` - rps amount, ``dur`` - load duration. You can set
fractional load like this: ``line(1.1, 2.5, 10)`` -- from 1.1rps to 2.5 for 10 seconds. Note: ``const(0, 10)`` - 0 rps for 10 seconds, in fact 10s pause
in a test.

``step`` and ``line`` could be used with increasing and decreasing
intensity: 

* ``step(25, 5, 5, 60)`` - stepped load from 25 to 5 rps, with 5 rps steps, 
  step duration 60s. ``step(5, 25, 5, 60)`` - stepped load from 5 to 25 rps, 
  with 5 rps steps, step duration 60s

* ``line(100, 1, 10m)`` - linear load from 100 to 1 rps, duration - 10
  minutes ``line(1, 100, 10m)`` - linear load from 1 to 100 rps, duration
  - 10 minutes

You can specify complex load schemes using those primitives, for example: ``rps_schedule=line(1,10,10m) const(10,10m)`` - linear load from 1 to 10, duration 10 mins and then 10 mins of 10 RPS constant load.

Time duration could be defined in seconds, minutes (m) and hours (h).
For example: ``27h103m645``

For a test with constant load at 10rps for 10 minutes, ``load.ini`` should
have next lines:

:: 

  [phantom] 
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port. 
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme

Voilà, Yandex.Tank setup is done.


Preparing requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to set up requests: Access mode, URI-style and request-style. 
Regardless of the chosen format, resulted file with requests could be gzipped - tank supports archived ammo files

Access mode
''''''''''''
You can use access.log file from your webserver as a source of requests.
Just add to load.ini options `ammo_type=access` and `ammofile=/tmp/access.log` 
where /tmp/access.log is a path to access.log file.

:: 

  [phantom] 
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port 
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  header_http = 1.1 
  headers = [Host: www.target.example.com] 
    [Connection: close] 
  ammofile=/tmp/access.log
  ammo_type=access

Parameter ``headers`` defines headers values (if it nessessary).

URI-style, URIs in load.ini
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Update configuration file with HTTP headers and URIs:

:: 

  [phantom] 
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port 
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  ; Headers and URIs for GET requests 
  header_http = 1.1 
  headers = [Host: www.target.example.com] 
    [Connection: close] 
  uris = /   
    /buy   
    /sdfg?sdf=rwerf   
    /sdfbv/swdfvs/ssfsf

Parameter ``uris`` contains uri, which should be used for requests generation.

URI-style, URIs in file
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Create a file with declared requests: **ammo.txt**

::

  [Connection: close] 
  [Host: target.example.com] 
  [Cookies: None] 
  /?drg 
  / 
  /buy 
  /buy/?rt=0&station_to=7&station_from=9

File begins with optional lines [...], that contain headers which will
be added to every request. After that section there is a list of URIs.
Every URI must begin from a new line, with leading '/'.
Each line that begins from '[' is considered a header.

URI+POST-style
''''''''''''''

Create a file with declared requests: **ammo.txt**

::

  [Host: example.org]
  [Connection: close] 
  [User-Agent: Tank]  
  5 /route/?rll=50.262025%2C53.276083~50.056015%2C53.495561&origin=1&simplify=1
  class
  10 /route/?rll=50.262025%2C53.276083~50.056015%2C53.495561&origin=1&simplify=1
  hello!clas
  7 /route/?rll=37.565147%2C55.695758~37.412796%2C55.691454&origin=1&simplify=1
  uripost

File begins with optional lines [...], that contain headers which will
be added to every request. After that section there is a list of URIs and POST bodies.
Each URI line begins with a number which is the size of the following POST body.
Set up ammo type in load.ini:

::

  ammo_type=uripost

Request-style
'''''''''''''

Full requests listed in a separate file. For more complex
requests, like POST, you'll have to create a special file. File format
is:

::

  [size_of_request] [tag]\n
  [request_headers]
  [body_of_request]\r\n
  [size_of_request2] [tag2]\n
  [request2_headers]
  [body_of_request2]\r\n


where ``size_of_request`` – request size in bytes. '\r\n' symbols after
``body`` are ignored and not sent anywhere, but it is required to
include them in a file after each request. '\r' is also required. 

**sample GET requests (null body)**

**sample req-style ammo generator (python):**

``usage: cat data | python make_ammo.py``
For each line of 'data' file this script will generate phantom ammo.
Line format: ``GET||/url||case_tag||body(optional)``

	    main()

Run Test!
~~~~~~~~~

1. Request specs in load.ini -- just run as ``yandex-tank``

2. Request specs in ammo.txt -- run as ``yandex-tank ammo.txt``

Yandex.Tank detects requests format and generates ultimate requests
versions.

``yandex-tank`` here is an executable file name of Yandex.Tank.

If Yandex.Tank has been installed properly and configuration file is
correct, the load will be given in next few seconds.

Results
~~~~~~~

During test execution you'll see HTTP and net errors, answer times
distribution, progressbar and other interesting data. At the same time
file ``phout.txt`` is being written, which could be analyzed later.

Tags
~~~~

Requests could be grouped and marked by some tag. Example of file with
requests and tags: 

::

  73 good 
  GET / HTTP/1.0 
  Host: xxx.tanks.example.com 
  User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)

  77 bad 
  GET /abra HTTP/1.0 
  Host: xxx.tanks.example.com 
  User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)

  75 unknown 
  GET /ab HTTP/1.0 
  Host: xxx.tanks.example.com 
  User-Agent: xxx (shell 1)

``good``, ``bad`` and ``unknown`` here are the tags.
**RESTRICTION: latin letters allowed only.**

SSL
~~~

To activate SSL add ``ssl = 1`` to ``load.ini``. Don't forget to change port
number to appropriate value. Now, our basic config looks like that:

::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80; target's port
  rps_schedule=const (10,10m) ;Load scheme
  ssl=1

Autostop 
~~~~~~~~

Autostop is an ability to automatically halt test execution
if some conditions are reached. 

HTTP and Net codes conditions 
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There is an option to define specific codes (404,503,100) as well as code
groups (3xx, 5xx, xx). Also you can define relative threshold (percent
from the whole amount of answer per second) or absolute (amount of
answers with specified code per second). Examples:

* ``autostop = http(4xx,25%,10)`` – stop test, if amount of 4xx http codes
in every second of last 10s period exceeds 25% of answers (relative
threshold) 

* ``autostop = net(101,25,10)`` – stop test, if amount of 101
net-codes in every second of last 10s period is more than 25 (absolute
threshold)

* ``autostop = net(xx,25,10)`` – stop test, if amount of
non-zero net-codes in every second of last 10s period is more than 25
(absolute threshold)

Average time conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example: ``autostop = time(1500,15)`` – stop test, if average answer
time exceeds 1500ms

So, if we want to stop test when all answers in 1 second period are 5xx
plus some network and timing factors - add autostop line to load.ini:

::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  [autostop]
  autostop=time(1,10)
    http(5xx,100%,1s)
    net(xx,1,30)

Logging
~~~~~~~

Looking into target's answers is quite useful in debugging. For doing
that add ``writelog = 1`` to ``load.ini``. 

**ATTENTION: Writing answers on
high load leads to intensive disk i/o usage and can affect test
accuracy.** 

Log format: 

::

  <metrics> 
  <body_request>
  <body_answer>

Where metrics are:

``size_in size_out response_time(interval_real) interval_event net_code``
(request size, answer size, response time, time to wait for response
from the server, answer network code) 

Example: 

::

  user@tank:~$ head answ_*.txt 
  553 572 8056 8043 0
  GET /create-issue HTTP/1.1
  Host: target.yandex.net
  User-Agent: tank
  Accept: */*
  Connection: close


  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/javascript;charset=UTF-8

For ``load.ini`` like this:
  
::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  writelog=1
  [autostop]
  autostop=time(1,10)
    http(5xx,100%,1s)
    net(xx,1,30)

Results in phout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

phout.txt - is a per-request log. It could be used for service behaviour
analysis (Excel/gnuplot/etc) It has following fields:
``time, tag, interval_real, connect_time, send_time, latency, receive_time, interval_event, size_out, size_in, net_code proto_code``

Phout example:

**NOTE:** as Yandex.Tank uses phantom as an http load engine and this
file is written by phantom, it contents depends on phantom version
installed on your Yandex.Tank system.

Graph and statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use included charting tool that runs as a webservice on localhost
OR
use your favorite stats packet, R, for example.

Custom timings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can set custom timings in ``load.ini`` with ``time_periods``
parameter like this:

::
  
  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  [aggregator]
  time_periods = 10 45 50 100 150 300 500 1s 1500 2s 3s 10s ; the last value - 10s is considered as connect timeout.

Thread limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``instances=N`` in ``load.ini`` limits number of simultanious
connections (threads). Test with 10 threads:

::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  instances=10

Dynamic thread limit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``instances_schedule = <instances increasing scheme>`` -- test with
active instances schedule will be performed if load scheme is not
defined. Bear in mind that active instances number cannot be decreased
and final number of them must be equal to ``instances`` parameter value.
load.ini example:

::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  instances_schedule = line(1,10,10m)
  ;load = const (10,10m) ;Load scheme is excluded from this load.ini as we used instances_schedule parameter

Custom stateless protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In necessity of testing stateless HTTP-like protocol, Yandex.Tank's HTTP
parser could be switched off, providing ability to generate load with
any data, receiving any answer in return. To do that add
``tank_type = 2`` to ``load.ini``. 

**Indispensable condition: Connection close must be initiated by remote side**

::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  instances=10
  tank_type=2

Gatling 
~~~~~~~

If server with Yandex.Tank have several IPs, they may be
used to avoid outcome port shortage. Use ``gatling_ip`` parameter for
that. Load.ini:

::

  [phantom]
  address=203.0.113.1 ;Target's address
  port=80 ;target's port
  rps_schedule=const(10, 10m) ;load scheme
  instances=10
  gatling_ip = IP1 IP2
